Homework 7(B) RELATIONAL STORAGE OF XML DOCUMENTS

DUE  SUNDAY NIGHT (easly Monday AM) April 18th, 4am


(1) Consider the book dtd at https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-use-cases/#tree

Derive a relational schema for storing documents that are valid according
to this DTD, following the procedure described in lecture
*   'normalize' the DTD
*   draw the graph 
*   specify the relational schema (table & column names; underline keys;
    indicate with arrows foreign key references)

[Please be sure the pictures are readable after you have uploaded them]

(2)

  Assuming that a document is stored in two database relations Edge and
  Leaf, as discussed in class.  (Note that you do not need to know the DTD
  or anything about the document.)  Write an SQL query and a Datalog query
  to retrieve the nodes for the following Xpath expression.  For full
  credit the Datalog query should be constructed
  "mechanically/agorithmically", with intermediate predicates and rules,
  using the instructions in the lecture notes.

                /state/river[text()="Mississippi"]/data(@capital)

SELECT r.capital
FROM river r, state s
WHERE r.pid = s.sid AND r.text = "Mississippi"

path(Start,Current) :- 	edge(Start,state,X),
			edge(X,river,Y),
			leaf(Y,Mississippi),
			edge(Y,capital,Z),
